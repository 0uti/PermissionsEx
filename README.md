### PermissionsEx fork
This fork was created to keep PermissionsEx 1.23.x up-to-date since the original repository is no longer maintained.
Make sure that you are on the `1.23.x` branch to browse the updated version (which supports at least Bukkit 1.12.2 servers).
Support for the `NetEvents` plugin has been removed in this version due to `NetEvents` no longer being available.
